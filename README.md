Built originally with Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13.6

As programs go, they don't get much simpler than this.
I use it to pin an easier-to-find logout option to the taskbar/start menu in public labs and classrooms at the university where I work.
It was created to replace an older vbscript shortcut that did the same thing, so we could turn off vbscript completely in a security initiative.

Includes an icon that will show and be visible in both dark and light modes, though I'd like to find a way to build adaptable icons that mimic what Windows is doing with Search, Task View, etc.

Use as you like.
